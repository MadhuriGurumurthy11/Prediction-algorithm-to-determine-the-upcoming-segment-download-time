# Prediction-algorithm-to-determine-the-upcoming-segment-download-time


Predictive analytics deals with extracting information from current data and using it to predict the future behavior patterns of the networks. These analysis would play a vital role. In this project, we propose an algorithm framework that based on the transfer rates of previous segments determines the maximum request rate that guarantees the next segment will be downloaded with 95% confidence.
